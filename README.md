-Welcome! I'm Beon.

A Brazilian native with a degree in Law School and Criminology and a specialization in women's rights gained through nearly seventeen years of experience. Additionally, I have worked as an interpreter and translator in five languages. Over the past decade, I've lived, learned, and cultivated a diverse range of skills and experiences in various countries and cultures around the globe.

I'm a lover of books, piano, music, languages, fencing clubes, corsets, to sew and everything related to Gothic Culture, Edwardian and Victorian Age. I am also a collector of  "Mourning Jewelery".

Currently, I live in Sweden, I'm pursuing full-stack software development studies and looking for new challenges and opportunities to develop new skills and acquire new learnings ✨
